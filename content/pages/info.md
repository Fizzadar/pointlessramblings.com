<img class="headshot" src="/img/pages/info/headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot of Nick Mills-Barrett" />

I am Nick Mills-Barrett, a full stack software engineer specialising in infrastructure and scaling backend services. I currently work at [Automattic](https://automattic.com) building [Beeper](https://beeper.com). In my spare time I maintain a few [side projects](/pages/work).

I've been blogging here at pointlessramblings.com on and off since 2006. I use this website as place to experiment with design which is something I enjoy greatly but am not particularly great at. You can see my [10 year review of past designs here](/posts/over-10-years-of-pointless-ramblings/). I am fairly certain this website has had more redesigns than blog posts.

I can be found around the internet with the username `fizzadar`, which has its origins in gaming and powerthirst parody videos. Many years ago I built & hosted a popular Garry's Mod gamemode, Zombified World, which is where the username first appeared.

### Color Scheme

This is the current color palette for Pointless Ramblings. The default is pink which happens to be my favorite color (tap or click to copy).
