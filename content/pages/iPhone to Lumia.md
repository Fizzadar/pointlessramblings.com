title: iPhone to Lumia
---

My notes from trying out a Lumia 1020 for 20 days instead of my iPhone 5C.


### First Day

+ Camera is, as expected, fantastic
+ Battery life: Lumia > iPhone
+ Lumia is MASSIVE, but feels nicer than the iPhone
+ Yellow


### Camera

+ Low-light test & cropped (left Lumia, right iPhone):

    <img class="half" src="/img/pages/iPhone_to_Lumia/iphone_chair_crop.png" />
</div>

+ Lumia allows for shooting in RAW/DNG format, which is awesome (left auto-5MP from Lumia Camera, right photoshop-imported 35MP RAW):

</div>

<div class="image big">
    <img class="half" src="/img/pages/iPhone_to_Lumia/street_standard.jpg" />
    <img class="half" src="/img/pages/iPhone_to_Lumia/street_dng.jpg" />
</div>


### Phone

+ Solid signal/call quality
+ Texting with the keyboard is excellent


### Apps

#### Internet Explorer

+ Pretty good, solid performance
+ Excellent tab view
+ Awful font rendering

#### Emails/Calendar/Alarms

+ Lovely, simple interface
+ Need a quicker archive option (emails)
+ No alarm stopwatch?

#### Music

+ Bit slow
+ Can't get it to default to playlists view when opening

#### Other Good Apps

+ OneNote
+ Facebook
+ NextGen reader
+ VGBA - yep, a GBA emulator - good luck finding that on the Apple Store
    * bonus: big screen makes it perfect in vertical mode (controls at bottom, gba size window at top)
+ Authenticator
+ Files (though file counts aren't always perfect)

#### Other Poor/Average Apps

+ Twitter
+ Flipboard (no offline access, no flip)

#### Missing Apps

+ Dropbox
