As part of my final year dissertation I've been learning about building web servers & apps using Lua, LuaJIT, LuaJIT+Nginx & Node. Because it's relatively simple to implement a basic HTTP server in each, I decided to run some benchmarks to compare them.

**Setup/Notes**

+ Nginx+LuaJIT has 1 worker process
+ All three are 'non-blocking' on IO operations
+ Each is set to only write "hello world"
+ Mostly looking at requests/s in results

### Tests & Results

#### Nginx+LuaJIT

### Discussion/Notes

Firstly it's worth mentioning that because this was only a simple "hello world" test this doesn't demonstrate a production environment comparison, only the raw speed of each option with it's default setup.

As for the problem when running 1,000 concurrency on Lua/LuaJIT I've no idea why it fails (because it still worked via a browser). I believe the benchmarks are still reasonably accurate as they were halted before the slowdown.

My Lua/LuaJIT implementations don't process/read any header fields, nor do they send any back (it's a *simple* server) I would expect this is the reason Lua/LuaJIT appears to fast. However it does demonstrate that a single process can easily handle 20,000 requests/s â€¦ Not if that single thread is Node, that is, which appears to peak at ~8,000 requests/s on every bit of hardware I've tested(?).

What I find most strange is the drop in performance in LuaJIT when increasing the number of concurrent connections when compared to the same change in Lua (both manage 22k req/s on 30 concurrent connections, but with 1,000: Lua managed 17k while JIT only 14k). This is unexpected/strange for a compiler which is designed speed up not only the compilation time but also the efficiency of the script itself (and it certainly works elsewhere - Luasocket issue?).


### Conclusion

Raw speed isn't everything, and some things (http level) should be left to a dedicated webserver (Nginx). Lua is the perfect language to 'embed' into the webserver to turn it into a webappserver. And Node is perfect because it'll be working with Javascript on the clientside, and not dealing with the http protocol.

So I'm going to be using a combination of LuaJIT+Nginx and Node.
