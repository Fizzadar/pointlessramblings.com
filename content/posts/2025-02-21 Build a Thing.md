title: Build a Thing

I recently started building a thing to help me track, manage and store content and links. It’s somewhat undefined, this is my note to self that kicked it off:

> not really sure what this is, but been on the mind for years really, some kind of totally private wiki/collection space.

It turns out building a thing just for myself is immensely satisfying. I can write scrappy code and hack features together without users to worry about. I can pivot functionality on a whim. I can tailor and tweak designs and layout to my hearts content.

This freedom has also meant I regularly experiment with code flows, unfamiliar libraries and tools and designs. It’s a great way to expand my knowledge and practice skills I’d otherwise miss.

So find a thing you want and build it. Don’t let anyone else ask for features or commit changes. Enjoy true coding freedom.

p.s. my thing is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/Fizzadar/cache.fyi) to view, but don’t you dare suggest any changes!
