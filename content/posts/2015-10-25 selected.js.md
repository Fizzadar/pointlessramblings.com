    });
</script>

[`selected.js`](http://github.com/Fizzadar/selected.js) is a dependency free `<select>` replacement. It supports both single and multiple select boxes, has a tiny JS & DOM footprint and is incredibly easy to style.

<div style="width: 50%; margin: 50px auto;">
    <select multiple class="selected selected-light">
        <option>Option one</option>
        <option selected>Option two</option>
        <option selected>Option three</option>
        <option>Option four</option>
        <option>Option five</option>
    </select>
</div>

Setting this up is as simple as:

    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="selected.min.css" />
    <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="selected-light.min.css" />

    <select multiple class="selected selected-light">
        <option>Option one</option>
        <option>Option two</option>
        ...
    </select>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="selected.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">selected.init();</script>

I created `selected.js` because I could not find a solid `<select>` replacement that didn't rely on jQuery. These days I often find jQuery to be [unnecessary](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com); I don't want to include an extra ~80+kb just for the sake of  usable `<select>` boxes.

`selected.js` keeps things as simple as possible by swapping out the original element with two lists, wrapped in a container. One displays the active options and the other the dropdown options. There's no complicated DOM structure or appending of elements to the body.

The end result is a `<select>` replacement that is lightweight in terms of both code (~4kb) and DOM usage. This makes it highly performant compared to it's jQuery based rivals. The flip side, of course, is that it only supports good/"modern" browsers (IE10+).

If you're looking for absolute speed, or just something simple, you might wish to give `selected.js` a try.
