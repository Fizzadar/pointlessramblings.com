During the day I work at [Automattic](https://automattic.com) building [Beeper](https://beeper.com), leading the infrastructure team. Lots of Kubernetes, Go services, bit of sysadmin. 

I also spend some of my spare time hacking on various code based projects. These are my current favorite in-progress projects:

        <h3>Babbleserv</h3>
        <p class="description"><em>Babbleserv is a Matrix homeserver built on top of FoundationDB primitives.</em></p>

I have also built, and mostly retired, many other projects over the years. My [GitHub](https://github.com/fizzadar) has some of them. While writing this I figured it'd be fun to make a rough timeline of major milestones along with the languages/skills used and learnt:

<div class="flex timeline">
    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h5>2005</h5>
        <h4>Started learning HTML/CSS</h4>
        <p>At 14 I signed up for Blogger and was instantly hooked. Not with blogging, but tweaking the theme and adding 88x31 buttons.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h5>2006 - 2008</h5>
        <h4>WordPress, PHP and VPS</h4>
        <p>Settled on this domain and moved to WordPress. Started picking up light PHP in the theme editor. Rented my first VPS and played with cPanel. Got going with JavaScript + jQuery.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h5>2008 - 2009</h5>
        <h4>Garry's Mod, Lua, SQL and dedicated servers</h4>
        <p>GMod changed everything. Fell in love with Lua writing custom gamemodes. Started renting dedicated servers and hosting. Created Zombified World gamemode, which became one of the most popular GMod servers. Ran a phpBB forum for ~20k member forum for the community. Frequented facepunch.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h5>2010</h5>
        <h4>Afterburst</h4>
        <p>Founded <a href="https://afterburst.com">Afterburst</a> selling VPS on Hetzner dedicated servers. I <a href="/posts/starting-a-business-for-250/">wrote about this back in 2013</a>. PHP stack and some not great management software (WHMCS, SolusVM).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h5>2011 - 2013</h5>
        <h4>University</h4>
        <p>Three incredible years in Newcastle doing comp sci. Stopped hosting gameservers but kept writing Lua (there's a few bits on GitHub). Wrote a static site generator <a href="https://github.com/fizzadar/luapress">Luapress</a> to replace WordPress for this blog.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h5>2013 - 2017</h5>
        <h4>EDITED</h4>
        <p>Started working at <a href="https://edited.com">EDITED</a>, quickly gravitated to infra/devops/systems/whatever-you-call-it. Picked up Python, which became my language of choice. Scaled enormous Elasticsearch clusters with thousands of servers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h5>2015</h5>
        <h4>pyinfra</h4>
        <p>First commits to <a href="https://pyinfra.com">pyinfra</a>, been working on it ever since. Three major versions. <a href="/posts/why-you-should-try-pyinfra/">Read why you should try pyinfra</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h5>2017 - 2021</h5>
        <h4>EDITED Team Lead</h4>
        <p>Led the infrastructure team at EDITED, scaling up the processing pipeline to >100M products/day. Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, Riak and more. Even more servers.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h5>2017</h5>
        <h4>Kanmail</h4>
        <p>Wrote <a href="https://kanmail.io">Kanmail</a> to scratch an itch. For years it was read only I would just open Gmail to send. Eventually implemented sending/attachments/etc. IMAP isn't too bad but the varied implementations are cursed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="timeline-item">
        <h5>2021 - now</h5>
        <h4>Beeper (an Automattic company)</h4>
        <p>Joined <a href="https://beeper.com">Beeper</a> running infrastructure. Scaled K8s beyond it's limits. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeper_(software)#Beeper_Mini">Beeper Mini</a>. Acquired by <a href="https://automattic.com">Automattic</a>. Still building the best chat app.</p>
